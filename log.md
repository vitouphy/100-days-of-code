# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June  28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Load "Topical Chat" dataset with dataloader for building a chatbot.

**Thoughts:** With Dataset and Dataloader package, it makes batching and shuffle a lot easier.

### Day 1: June  29, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Using PyTorch Vocab to get index for each token and start implementing GRU-based Seq2Seq

**Thoughts:** Using PyTorch Lightning framework with Seq2Seq is somewhat confusing just to consider which is to ouput from `forward` function.
